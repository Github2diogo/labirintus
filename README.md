he nidaqmx package contains an API (Application Programming Interface) for interacting with the NI-DAQmx driver. The package is implemented in Python. The package is implemented as a complex, highly object-oriented wrapper around the NI-DAQmx C API using the ctypes Python library.

nidaqmx supports all versions of the NI-DAQmx driver that ships with the C API. The C API is included in any version of the driver that supports it. The nidaqmx package does not require installation of the C header files.

Some functions in the nidaqmx package may be unavailable with earlier versions of the NI-DAQmx driver. Visit the ni.com/downloads to upgrade your version of NI-DAQmx.
